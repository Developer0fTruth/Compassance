# === MAIN CONFIG ==========================================
#   Self explanatory descriptions below.
# ==========================================================

# ===== NOTE ===============================================
#   You should not mess with the version node, it is a way
#   for the plugin to detect if the templates do not match
#   a possible new version or updates. Back up this file
#   and download a new one if the plugin mentions any
#   errors regarding 'player text outdated'.
# ==========================================================
version: 1.1

# ==========================================================
#   This option will send data such as player count and
#   java version to mcstats.org. Compassance uses
#   MetricsLite which will only send basic information.
#   You can check out what it collects at:
#      http://mcstats.org/plugin/Compassance
# ==========================================================
metrics: true

# ==========================================================
#   If this is enabled, all themes will not require
#   permission, but you can set certain themes to require
#   them by adding the 'permission' node in the 'meta'
#   section.
# ==========================================================
use-permissions: true

# ==========================================================
#   If this is enabled, players can enable tracking.
# ==========================================================
use-tracking: true

# ==========================================================
#   This feature enables you to (MAYBE) get some features
#   that I have left over or haven't fully implemented
#   yet. I won't even tell you what I added to the bleeding
#   edge option until I finally finish developing it.
# ==========================================================
bleeding-edge: false
