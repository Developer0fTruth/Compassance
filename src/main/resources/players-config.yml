# === PLAYER CONFIG ========================================
#   Here you will find all the player data settings read
#   by the plugin. I do not recomend editing this while
#   the plugin is still running, as reloading will instantly
#   overwrite your changes with the server changes.
# ==========================================================

# ===== NOTE ===============================================
#   You should not mess with the version node, it is a way
#   for the plugin to detect if the templates do not match
#   a possible new version or updates. Back up this file
#   and download a new one if the plugin mentions any
#   errors regarding 'player settings outdated'.
# ==========================================================
